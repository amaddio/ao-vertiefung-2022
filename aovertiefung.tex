\begin{document}
\maketitle
Pandemic related changes in work-life have sparkled a flood of research investigating the psychological effects of remote work. Videoconferencing turns out to be one of the most used communication media to replace a risky face-to-face meeting with a non-risky video based alternative \parencite{Riedl2021}.  Research shares the belief that videoconferencing has a fatiguing psychological effect on its users. The so called \textit{Zoom-Fatigue} seems to be a common reaction to the new media use. The daunting effect is attributed to cue characteristics which are not natural compared to a face-to-face conversation \parencite{Riedl2021}. Our perception has been evolutionary evolved by natural social communication and its cues (verbal, mimic, gesture etc.). If humans are capable to evolve in that sense, why wouldn't humans also adjust to new communication characteristics over time? Therefore, I investigate the experience of one individual in a single case study to explore potential changes in perception and behavior towards videoconferencing over time.

\section{Theoretical Background}

In 1983, \citeauthor{daft1983information} proposed a theory that describes a media's ability to support communication on a richness scale. That is, how helpful the use of e.g. a telephone is to transport information required to "reduce uncertainty and clarify ambiguity" (p 5). Media is rated from rich to lean, where Face-to-Face is the richest and numerical formal computer output is lowest in richness. The theory objectively assigns richness to a media, even though the authors mention themselves that richness is somewhat dependent on the task requirement to "provide new substantial understanding" (p. 7). Looking at today's fully/partially remote organizations, this categorization seems questionable at first glance. Given that, teams in these organizations are (1) still functioning and (2) provide enough work for the organization to survive economically.

According to \citeauthor{Kock2005}, this lack of diminished outcome quality is explained by the workers' efforts to compensate for the hindering characteristics of a medium. The two theories are not contradictory. Instead, \citeauthor{Kock2005} supports by suggesting that the media barriers increase communication ambiguity and required cognitive effort to process relevant pieces of information. He calls workers' behavior to "overcompensate" with lean media information processing: Compensatory Adaption (p. 270). If the assumptions are true, then (1) the increased cognitive demand should have an effect on a worker's well-being and (2) the compensatory adaption should have a null effect on team effectiveness, i.e., it should not decrease.

Most of the studies that have been conducted on the fatigue effects of videoconferencing have been one-time data collections. This case study examines changes in this effect over time. This means that the variable of interest must allow for changes in media richness. \cite{Carlson1999} considers media richness as a subjective variable–controversy to \citeauthor{daft1983information}. The authors argue that richness is a personal (subjective) evaluation that one derives from experience. More specifically, experience with the (1) communication partner, (2) channel (media), (3) its topic and the (4) organizational context form a knowledge base. This knowledge can be used to adequately decode information even though the communication media does not naturally support to transfer relevant cues. Similarly, data can be enriched from the sender by encoding information that alleviates understanding by the receiver–which could not be inferred rationally from the raw media message. To summarize: Experience leads to knowledge and shapes the perceived media richness.

A potential scenario of changes in perception is given: A person begins to use videoconferencing software. The person struggles to maintain speaking order and the voices overlap disturbingly. The person considers the medium as rather lean as it lacks natural cues which are present in a face-to-face conversation. Over time, the same person raises a virtual hand to improve speaking-order and diminish confusion (information encoding). In the meantime, the person perceives videoconferencing as richer than before. As a listener, the same person was distracted by the mirroring camera and could not focus on the other people. Over time, the person turns off the mirroring camera to reduce self-attention biases (information decoding) (see also \cite{Riedl2021}).

Taken together, it is hypothesized that, a developed knowledge base of functional behaviors (1) increases the perceived richness of a medium and (2) reduces a remote worker's cognitive effort, hence well-being as well as should (3) maintain (or increase) communication effectiveness even though communication is based remotely on videoconferencing software.

Note: In this case study, only learning experiences in encoding and decoding information are respected that effect perceived Media Richness.

\section{Case Study}

The interviewed person is of female sex, 34 years old, married and has one son (17 months). She graduated from a hotel management school, and worked in hotels as a senior convention sales manager. Because of the pandemic crisis and flat hotel booking rates, she moved to a more secure job in a technology start-up 2.5 years ago, where she has been on parental leave for 12 months. The company uses \textit{Gather.town} as its primary video-conferencing tool. She spends 25\% of her time at work communicating in Gather.

The interview took place on 01-30-2023 at 10:30am and lasted $\approx$55 minutes. The interviewee reported preferring face-to-face conversations and to not spend more time than necessary in front of a computer or smartphone. Digital communication in her previous work experience was limited to email and phone. She was selected because she represents an en/decoding expert in natural face-to-face conversations, but a person with a novice-level of videoconferencing skills in a remote work scenario. 

\subsection{Results}

The results have been assembled into the categories of decoding/encoding experiences that form Perceived Media Richness and its reported effects on the subject's well-being and perceived communication effectiveness (see Figure 1).
